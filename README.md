A program that can play scrabble at or near championship level.
to place tiles select them by left clicking, then place them with another left click, if you would like to return them to the rack right click them from the board.
the computer will automatically take its turn once you submit your move, and you can have the computer take your turn by clicking the generate button.
when a blank is placed use the console window to input which letter you wish it to represent.
if the computer takes longer than ~0.1 seconds to choose a move it likely has a blank tile, the program is not stalled. This is because the presence of a blank tile vastly increases the search space.
